# ContactsAppFrontend

A full-stack contact management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete contact information. This project includes both the frontend and backend, with a focus on backend testing using Jest to ensure API reliability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Git, GitHub
- Jest (for backend testing)

## 📌 Features
- ✔️ Full-stack contact management system with CRUD operations.
- ✔️ Pagination and search functionality for easy contact browsing.
- ✔️ Backend testing with Jest to ensure API reliability.
  
## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

Notes: 
- Make sure contacts-app-backend is running first to ensure retrieval of backend data
